with this repo you'll need two things to get it off the ground

1. an api key for a discord project to connect your bot to discord
2. an environment with python installed to eval the commands

start the bot with node bot then any discord chat which has accepted it's invite 
just needs to wrap their code in <pyhton>...<pyhton>
